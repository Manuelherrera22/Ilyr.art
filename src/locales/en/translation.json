      "questions": [
        { "question": "Does ILYR.art's AI replace professional designers?", "answer": "Absolutely not! ILYR.art is a symbiotic tool designed to enhance human creativity. Our AI automates complex and repetitive technical tasks, freeing up designers and artists to focus on strategy, conceptualization, art direction, and the unique spark only a human can provide. It's a human-AI collaboration for exponential results." },
        { "question": "Can I download the results and what formats are available?", "answer": "Yes, of course. The available formats and resolutions depend on your subscription plan. We offer everything from web-optimized previews (JPG, PNG) to ultra-high-resolution master files (4K/8K+, formats like EXR, TIFF, and ProRes/DNxHR video sequences). Studio and Enterprise plans unlock the most professional and customizable options." },
        { "question": "How does the payment process work for a commissioned production?", "answer": "Full productions are quoted on a custom basis after you approve the AI-generated preview and we define the final scope. We will provide you with a transparent and detailed budget. Typically, we work with an initial payment (e.g., 50%) to start production, and the rest is settled upon final delivery and your complete satisfaction." },
        { "question": "Can I use ILYR.art if I have no technical knowledge of design or 3D?", "answer": "Definitely! ILYR.art is designed with an intuitive interface and guided workflows. If you have a clear idea, you can generate impactful visualizations with ease. For advanced users, we offer granular controls and deep customization options, but the foundation is accessible and empowering for all experience levels." },
        { "question": "What level of customization do I have over the style of the AI-generated scene?", "answer": "With ILYR.Studio™ (available in Creator plans and up), you will have significant artistic control to adjust camera angles, dynamic lighting, PBR materials, color palettes, atmospheric effects, composition, and much more. The AI gives you an excellent and highly adaptable starting point, and you refine it to perfection." },
        { "question": "What types of files can I upload as an initial reference for the AI?", "answer": "You can upload images in common formats like JPG, PNG, WEBP, and even GIFs. For more complex ideas or 3D references, in advanced plans, we support formats like .obj, .fbx, and others, subject to project specifications. We are constantly expanding format compatibility." },
        { "question": "How long does it typically take to generate a high-quality AI preview?", "answer": "Basic previews are generated in a matter of seconds to a couple of minutes. More complex visualizations or those with a higher level of photorealism may take a bit longer, but our platform is cloud-optimized to deliver speed without sacrificing final quality. Exact times vary depending on complexity." },
        { "question": "How do you ensure the security and confidentiality of my files and ideas on the platform?", "answer": "The security and confidentiality of your projects are our top priority. We use end-to-end encryption (AES-256), industry-standard security protocols (SSL/TLS), and secure cloud storage. Your creations and ideas are and always will be yours. See our privacy policy for more details." }
